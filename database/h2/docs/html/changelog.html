<h1>Change Log</h1>

<h2>Changes in Version 1.4 Beta (unreleased)</h2>
<ul><li>By default, the MV_STORE option is enabled, so it is using the new MVStore storage. The MVCC setting is set to the same values as the MV_STORE setting, so it is also enabled by default. For testing, both settings can be disabled by appending ";MV_STORE=FALSE" / ";MVCC=FALSE" to the database URL. </li><li>The file locking method 'serialized' is no longer supported. This mode might return in a future version, however this is not clear right now. A new implementation and new tests would be needed. </li><li>Enable the new storage format for dates (system property "h2.storeLocalTime"). For the MVStore mode, this is always enabled, but with version 1.4 this is even enabled in the PageStore mode. </li><li>Implicit relative paths are disabled (system property "h2.implicitRelativePath"), so that the database URL jdbc:h2:test now needs to be written as jdbc:h2:./test. </li><li>"select ... fetch first 1 row only" is supported with the regular mode. This was disabled so far because "fetch" is now a keyword. See also Mode.supportOffsetFetch. </li><li>Byte arrays are now sorted in unsigned mode (x'99' is larger than x'09'). (System property "h2.sortBinaryUnsigned", Mode.binaryUnsigned, setting "binary_collation"). </li><li>Csv.getInstance will be removed in future versions of 1.4. Use the public constructor instead. </li><li>Remove support for the limited old-style outer join syntax using "(+)". Use "outer join" instead. System property "h2.oldStyleOuterJoin". </li></ul>

<h2>Next Version (unreleased)</h2>
<ul><li>- </li></ul>

<h2>Version 1.3.176 (2014-04-05)</h2>
<ul><li>The file locking method 'serialized' is no longer documented, as it will not be available in version 1.4. </li><li>The static method Csv.getInstance() was removed. Use the public constructor instead. </li><li>The default user name for the Script, RunScript, Shell, and CreateCluster tools are no longer "sa" but an empty string. </li><li>The stack trace of the exception "The object is already closed" is no longer logged by default. </li><li>If a value of a result set was itself a result set, the result could only be read once. </li><li>Column constraints are also visible in views (patch from Nicolas Fortin for H2GIS). </li><li>Granting a additional right to a role that already had a right for that table was not working. </li><li>Spatial index: a few bugs have been fixed (using spatial constraints in views, transferring geometry objects over TCP/IP, the returned geometry object is copied when needed). </li><li>Issue 551: the datatype documentation was incorrect (found by Bernd Eckenfels). </li><li>Issue 368: ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE did not work for multi-row inserts. Test case from Angus Macdonald. </li><li>OSGi: the package javax.tools is now imported (as an optional). </li><li>H2 Console: auto-complete is now disabled by default, but there is a hot-key (Ctrl+Space). </li><li>H2 Console: auto-complete did not work with multi-line statements. </li><li>CLOB and BLOB data was not immediately removed after a rollback. </li><li>There is a new Aggregate API that supports the internal H2 data types (GEOMETRY for example). Thanks a lot to Nicolas Fortin for the patch! </li><li>Referential integrity constraints sometimes used the wrong index, such that updating a row in the referenced table incorrectly failed with a constraint violation. </li><li>The Polish translation was completed and corrected by Wojtek Jurczyk. Thanks a lot! </li><li>Issue 545: Unnecessary duplicate code was removed. </li><li>The profiler tool can now process files with full thread dumps. </li><li>MVStore: the file format was changed slightly. </li><li>MVStore mode: the CLOB and BLOB storage was re-implemented and is now much faster than with the PageStore (which is still the default storage). </li><li>MVStore mode: creating indexes is now much faster (in many cases faster than with the default PageStore). </li><li>Various bugs in the MVStore storage and have been fixed, including a bug in the R-tree implementation. The database could get corrupt if there were transient IO exceptions while storing. </li><li>The method org.h2.expression.Function.getCost could throw a NullPointException. </li><li>Storing LOBs in separate files (outside of the main database file) is no longer supported for new databases. </li><li>Lucene 2 is no longer supported. </li><li>Fix bug in calculating default MIN and MAX values for SEQUENCE. </li><li>Fix bug in performing IN queries with multiple values when IGNORECASE=TRUE </li><li>Add entry-point to org.h2.tools.Shell so it can be called from inside an application. patch by Thomas Gillet. </li><li>Fix bug that prevented the PgServer from being stopped and started multiple times. </li><li>Support some more DDL syntax for MySQL, patch from Peter Jentsch. </li><li>Issue 548: TO_CHAR does not format MM and DD correctly when the month or day of the month is 1 digit, patch from "the.tucc" </li><li>Fix bug in varargs support in ALIAS's, patch from Nicolas Fortin </li></ul>

<h2>Version 1.3.175 (2014-01-18)</h2>
<ul><li>EXPLAIN was incorrect for queries with "ANY" or "SOME" conditions. </li><li>CallableStatement with "out" parameters: running the same statement twice could result in an exception ("parameter not set"). </li><li>Union queries: duplicate rows could be returned if the sub-queries contained "order by". </li><li>The GEOMETRY data type now works for user defined functions that return a result set. </li><li>PostgreSQL compatibility: the PgServer was not working properly when the setting database_to_upper was set to false. </li><li>JdbcDataSource: the methods setUrl and getUrl where added as aliases for setURL and getURL. This should solve problems with the HikariCP (Hikari connection pool). </li><li>Issue 537: H2 Console: when loading the schema, incorrect JDBC calls where issued, which caused the exception "Column PRECISION not found". </li><li>Improved Geometry processing (issue 535). </li><li>The collation can now be set in the database URL, even if there are data tables, if the collection is the same as the current collation. </li><li>Improved Oracle compatibility for CASE WHEN and DECODE. </li><li>The statement "drop all objects" did not work if a table depends on a view via a constraint. </li><li>Subqueries or views with "order by" an alias expression could not be executed due to a regression introduced in version 1.3.174. </li><li>Issue 73: MySQL compatibility: support REPLACE, patch by Cemo Koc. </li><li>The spatial index now works in MVCC mode when using the MVStore storage. </li><li>MVStore: concurrency problems have been fixed. The API has been simplified. </li><li>Improve error message when dropping an index that belongs to a constraint, specify constraint in error message. </li><li>Issue 518: java.sql.Connection.commit() freezes after LOB modification with EXCLUSIVE connection </li><li>Issue 517: Create or replace view statement has no effect on the others already existing JDBC connection </li><li>Support 123L syntax as in Java; example: SELECT (2000000000L*2). </li><li>Issue 520: Add support for sequence max value, min value and cycle, patch by Daniel Gredler. </li><li>Issue 521: ScriptReader should implement Closeable </li><li>Issue 524: RunScript.execute does not close its Statement, patch from Gaul. </li><li>Add support for DB2 "WITH UR" clause, patch from litailang </li><li>Added support for ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE like MySQL with the values() function to update with the value that was to be inserted. Patch from Jean-Francois Noel. </li><li>Issue 522: Treat empty strings like NULL in Oracle compatibility mode, patch by Daniel Gredler. </li><li>Issue 527: Oracle compatibility mode: incorrect scale behavior, patch by Daniel Gredler. </li><li>Slightly reduce the memory cost of View metadata. </li><li>Extend support of "GRANT ALTER ANY SCHEMA TO &lt;user&gt;" to allow grantee ability to manipulate tables </li><li>Issue 532: Javadoc for ErrorCode.ROLES_AND_RIGHT_CANNOT_BE_MIXED looks wrong </li><li>Issue 528: Add Oracle-compatible TO_CHAR function, patch by Daniel Gredler. </li><li>Issue 534: CREATE ALIAS NOCACHE, Patch by Nicolas Fortin </li><li>Fix an issue with storing Unicode surrogate pairs in CLOB columns. </li><li>H2 console: add SHIFT+ENTER "run selected" functionality </li><li>Fix bug in DB2 syntax "select * from test with ur", patch from litailang </li><li>Fix bug in DROP ALL OBJECTS when dealing with inter-schema dependencies. </li></ul>

<h2>Version 1.3.174 (2013-10-19)</h2>
<ul><li>LIRS cache: bugfix for caches that only contain non-resident entries. </li><li>For in-memory databases, queries with a "group by" column that is also a hash index threw a RuntimeException. </li><li>Improved error message for some syntax errors. </li><li>File system abstraction: if used directly, some file systems did not work correctly with spliced byte buffers (the database engine doesn't use those). </li><li>To use the MVStore storage engine (which is still work in progress), append ";mv_store=true" to the database URL. Using the MVTableEngine when creating the table is no longer recommended. </li><li>To compile user defined functions, the javax.tools.JavaCompiler is now used if available, and no temporary files are created. This should solve problems when multiple H2 database concurrently compile the same user defined functions. To disable, system the system property "h2.javaSystemCompiler" to false. </li><li>Concurrently creating function aliases in different databases could result in the exception "javac: file not found". </li><li>The function "regexp_replace" threw the wrong kind of exception if the replacement string was invalid. </li><li>A checkpoint is now done every MAX_LOG_SIZE / 2 instead of every MAX_LOG_SIZE, so that the transaction log doesn't grow as large. </li><li>MVStore table engine: new setting "retention_time" to configure the time to retain old data. The default is 45 seconds. </li><li>The method TableEngine.createTable() now returns a Table object. </li><li>For read-only databases, for the trace level "debug", the trace info is written to the temp directory. </li><li>Closing the file lock will now wait until the background thread is stopped. </li><li>In version 1.3.172, a performance regression was introduced when fixing the issue 389 (when there is a multi-column primary key, H2 does not seem to always pick the right index). This was related to boosting an index that matches the "order by" column list (the wrong index was used in some cases). </li><li>Improved spatial index and data type. </li><li>Issue 467: OSGi Class Loader (ability to create reference to class in other ClassLoader, for example in another OSGi bundle). </li><li>Queries "group by" that contain a subquery with an aggregate function returned the wrong result in some cases. </li><li>Fix bug in unique and non-unique hash indexes which manifested as incorrect results when the search key was a different cardinal type from the table index key. e.g. where the one was INT and the other was LONG </li><li>Bug: Changes to the database structure did not result in the Session query cache being invalidated. </li><li>New feature from Davide Cavestro - allow using custom Java object serialization engines on a per-DB basis. </li><li>When running the Recover tool on very large (&gt;6G) databases, some statistics were reported with negative numbers. </li><li>Add a CONTAINS_UNCOMMITTED column to the SESSIONS metadata table, to allow detecting when rogue sessions are creating large transactions. </li><li>Some small fixes to the GEOMETRY support, patches by Nicolas Fortin. </li><li>The BNF tool and the autocomplete feature are exported in OSGi, which makes it possible for smart editors to do autocomplete. Patch from Nicolas Fortin. </li><li>Fix DROP ALL OBJECTS and DROP SCHEMA in the presence of tables with computed column dependencies. </li><li>Session-temporary LOB's could sometimes accumulate, increasing the size of the DB file until shutdown. Now they are cleared out at every commit. </li><li>There was a bug where a hash index with more than one column would be silently converted to a regular index. It will now throw an exception. </li><li>Query Statistics: new feature which stores the newest 100 SQL queries executed and their performance data. Useful for tracking down badly performing queries. </li><li>Fix an LOB deadlock between reading and updating LOB columns. </li><li>Support the JDBC DatabaseMetaData#getClientInfoProperties() method, in the sense of returning an empty result, in order to make WebSphere happy. </li><li>Make Server#openBrowser respect the $BROWSER environment variable. Add "chromium" to the list of browsers tried. Patch from Felix Kaiser. </li><li>Fix to org.h2.util.ScriptReader when handling unclosed block comments. </li><li>Make org.h2.util.ScriptReader throw a better exception when handling broken scripts which generate extremely large statements. </li><li>Fix bug with ALLOW_LITERALS=NONE, where the periodic analyze table on insert would throw an exception. A similar problem was fixed in the Console tool. </li><li>Issue 510: Make org.h2.bnf public for consumption by external projects, patch by Nicolas Fortin </li><li>Issue 509: Important fix on ValueGeometry, patch by Nicolas Fortin (with some tweaking) Make ValueGeometry#getDimensionCount more reliable. Add unit test to check for illegal ValueGeometry comparison Add unit test for conversion of Geometry object into Object Add optional export to MANIFEST.MF for JTS Geometry classes Validate that geometry values can be represented in WKB. </li><li>Issue 506: RFE: Include Thread.getName() in case of a deadlock </li><li>Adding support for "GRANT ALTER ANY SCHEMA TO &lt;user&gt;", patch by John Yates </li></ul>

<h2>Version 1.3.173 (2013-07-28)</h2>
<ul><li>Support empty statements that just contains a comment. </li><li>Server mode: if there was an error while reading from a LOB, the session was closed in some cases. </li><li>Issue 463: Driver name and version are now the same in OsgiDataSourceFactory and JdbcDatabaseMetaData. </li><li>JaQu: The data type VARCHAR is now (again) used for Strings (no longer TEXT, except when explicitly set). </li><li>For in-memory databases, creating an index on a CLOB or BLOB column is no longer supported. This is to simplify the MVTableEngine. </li><li>New column "information_schema.tables.row_count_estimate". </li><li>Issue 468: trunc(timestamp) could return the wrong value (+12 hours), and trunc(number) throw a NullPointerException. </li><li>The expression trunc(number) threw a NullPointerException. </li><li>Fixed a deadlock when updating LOB's concurrently. See TestLob.testDeadlock2(). </li><li>Fixed a deadlock related to very large temporary result sets. </li><li>Add "-list" command line option to Shell tool so that result-list-mode can be triggered when reading from a file. </li><li>Issue 474: H2 MySQL Compatibility code fails to ignore "COMMENT" in CREATE TABLE, patch from Aaron Azeckoski. </li><li>Issue 476: Broken link in jaqu.html </li><li>Fix potential UTF8 encoding issue in org.h2.store.FileStore, reported by Juerg Spiess. </li><li>Improve error message when check constraint is broken, test case from Gili (cowwoc). </li><li>Improve error message when we have a unique constraint violation, displays the offending key in the error message. </li><li>Issue 478: Support for "SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL", patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Issue 475: PgServer: add support for CancelRequest, patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Issue 473: PgServer missing -key option, patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Issue 471: CREATE VIEW does not check user rights, patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Issue 477: PgServer binary transmission of query params is unimplemented, patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Issue 479: Support for SUBSTRING without a FROM condition, patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Issue 472: PgServer does not work with any recent Postgres JDBC driver, patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Add syntax for passing additional parameters into custom TableEngine implementations. </li><li>Issue 480: Bugfix post issue 475, 477, patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Issue 481: Further extensions to PgServer to support better support PG JDBC, patch from Andrew Franklin. </li><li>Add support for spatial datatype GEOMETRY. </li><li>Add support for in-memory spatial index. </li><li>change the PageStore#changeCount field from an int to a long, to cope with databases with very high transaction rates. </li><li>Fix a NullPointerException when attempting to add foreign key reference to a view. </li><li>Add sufficient ClientInfo support to our javax.sql.Connection implementation to make WebSphere happy. </li><li>Issue 482: class LobStorageBackend$LobInputStream does not override the method InputStream.available(). </li><li>Fix corruption resulting from a mix of the "WRITE_DELAY=0" option and "SELECT DISTINCT" queries that don't fit in memory. </li><li>Fix the combination of updating a table which contains an LOB, and reading from the LOB at the same time. Previously it would throw an exception, now it works. </li><li>Issue 484: In the H2 Console tool, all schemas starting with "INFO" where hidden. Now they are hidden only if the database is not H2.

<h2>Version 1.3.172 (2013-05-25)</h2>
<ul><li>Referential integrity: when adding a referential integrity constraint failed, and if creating the constraint automatically created an index, this index was not removed. </li><li>The auto-analyze feature now only reads 1000 rows per table instead of 10000. </li><li>The optimization for IN(...) queries combined with OR could result in a strange exception of the type "column x must be included in the group by list". </li><li>Issue 454: Use Charset for type-safety. </li><li>Queries with both LIMIT and OFFSET could throw an IllegalArgumentException. </li><li>MVStore: multiple issues were fixed: 460, 461, 462, 464, 466. </li><li>MVStore: larger stores (multiple GB) are now much faster. </li><li>When using local temporary tables and not dropping them manually before closing the session, and then killing the process could result in a database that couldn't be opened (except when using the recover tool). </li><li>Support TRUNC(timestamp) for improved Oracle compatibility. </li><li>Add support for CREATE TABLE TEST (ID BIGSERIAL) for PostgreSQL compatibility. Patch from Jesse Long. </li><li>Add new collation command SET BINARY_COLLATION UNSIGNED, helps with people testing BINARY columns in MySQL mode. </li><li>Issue 453: ABBA race conditions in TABLE LINK connection sharing. </li><li>Issue 449: Postgres Serial data type should not automatically be marked as primary key </li><li>Issue 406: Support "select h2version()" </li><li>Issue 389: When there is a multi-column primary key, H2 does not seem to always pick the right index </li><li>Issue 305: Implement SELECT ... FOR FETCH ONLY </li><li>Issue 274: Sybase/MSSQLServer compatibility - Add GETDATE and CHARINDEX system functions </li><li>Issue 274: Sybase/MSSQLServer compatibility - swap parameters of CONVERT function. </li><li>Issue 274: Sybase/MSSQLServer compatibility - support index clause e.g. "select * from test (index table1_index)" </li><li>Fix bug in Optimizing SELECT * FROM A WHERE X=1 OR X=2 OR X=3 into SELECT * FROM A WHERE X IN (1,2,3) </li><li>Issue 442: Groovy patch for SourceCompiler (function ALIAS) </li><li>Issue 459: Improve LOB documentation </li></ul>

<h2>Version 1.3.171 (2013-03-17)</h2>
<ul><li>Security: the TCP server did not correctly restrict access rights of clients in some cases. This was specially a problem when using the flag "tcpAllowOthers". </li><li>H2 Console: the session timeout can now be configured using the system property "h2.consoleTimeout". </li><li>Issue 431: Improved compatibility with MySQL: support for "ENGINE=InnoDB charset=UTF8" when creating a table. </li><li>Issue 249: Improved compatibility with MySQL in the MySQL mode: now the methods DatabaseMetaData methods stores*Case*Identifiers return the same as MySQL when using the MySQL mode. </li><li>Issue 434: H2 Console didn't work in the Chrome browser due to a wrong viewport argument. </li><li>There was a possibility that the .lock.db file was not deleted when the database was closed, which could slow down opening the database. </li><li>The SQL script generated by the "script" command contained inconsistent newlines on Windows. </li><li>When using trace level 4 (SLF4J) in the server mode, a directory "trace.db" and an empty file was created on the client side. This is no longer made. </li><li>Optimize IN(...) queries: there was a bug in version 1.3.170 if the type of the left hand side didn't match the type of the right hand side. Fixed. </li><li>Optimize IN(...) queries: there was a bug in version 1.3.170 for comparison of the type "X IN(NULL, NULL)". Fixed. </li><li>Timestamps with timezone that were passed as a string were not always converted correctly. For example "2012-11-06T23:00:00.000Z" was converted to "2012-11-06" instead of to "2012-11-07" in the timezone CET. Thanks a lot to Steve Hruda for reporting the problem! </li><li>New table engine "org.h2.mvstore.db.MVTableEngine" that internally uses the MVStore to persist data. To try it out, append ";DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE=org.h2.mvstore.db.MVTableEngine" to the database URL. This is still very experimental, and many features are not supported yet. The data is stored in a file with the suffix ".mv.db". </li><li>New connection setting "DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE" to use a specific table engine if none is set explicitly. This is to simplify testing the MVStore table engine. </li><li>MVStore: encrypted stores are now supported. Only standardized algorithms are used: PBKDF2, SHA-256, XTS-AES, AES-128. </li><li>MVStore: improved API thanks to Simo Tripodi. </li><li>MVStore: maps can now be renamed. </li><li>MVStore: store the file header also at the end of each chunk, which results in a further reduced number of write operations. </li><li>MVStore: a map implementation that supports concurrent operations. </li><li>MVStore: unified exception handling; the version is included in the messages. </li><li>MVStore: old data is now retained for 45 seconds by default. </li><li>MVStore: compress is now disabled by default, and can be enabled on request. </li><li>Support ALTER TABLE ADD ... AFTER. Patch from Andrew Gaul (argaul at gmail.com). Fixes issue 401. </li><li>Improved OSGi support. H2 now registers itself as a DataSourceFactory service. Fixes issue 365. </li><li>Add a DISK_SPACE_USED system function.

This was only a problem if the H2 Console was run for a long time and many sessions were opened. </li><li>Issue 412: Running the Server tool with just the option "-browser" will now log a warning. </li><li>Issue 411: CloseWatcher registration was not concurrency-safe. </li><li>MySQL compatibility: support for CONCAT_WS. Thanks a lot to litailang for the patch! </li><li>PostgreSQL compatibility: support for EXTRACT(WEEK FROM dateColumn).

<h2>Version 1.3.169 (2012-09-09)</h2>
<ul><li>The default jar file is now compiled for Java 6. </li><li>The new jar file will probably not end up in the central Maven repository in the next few weeks because Sonatype has disabled automatic synchronization from SourceForge (which they call 'legacy sync' now). It will probably take some time until this is sorted out. The H2 jar files are deployed to http://h2database.com/m2-repo/com/h2database/h2/maven-metadata.xml and http://hsql.sourceforge.net/m2-repo/com/h2database/h2/maven-metadata.xml as usual. </li><li>A part of the documentation and the H2 Console has been changed to support the Apple retina display. </li><li>The CreateCluster tool could not be used if the source database contained a CLOB or BLOB. The root cause was that the TCP server did not synchronize on the session, which caused a problem when using the exclusive mode. </li><li>Statement.getQueryTimeout(): only the first call to this method will query the database. If the query timeout was changed in another way than calling setQueryTimeout, this method will always return the last value. This was changed because Hibernate calls getQueryTimeout() a lot. </li><li>Issue 416: PreparedStatement.setNString throws AbstractMethodError. All implemented JDBC 4 methods that don't break compatibility with Java 5 are now included in the default jar file. </li><li>Issue 414: for some functions, the parameters were evaluated twice (for example "char(nextval(..))" ran "nextval(..)" twice). </li><li>The ResultSetMetaData methods getSchemaName and getTableName could return null instead of "" (an empty string) as specified in the JDBC API. </li><li>Added compatibility for "SET NAMES" query in MySQL compatibility mode.</li>
